For the file: “Experiment_1_in_vitro_Martin_etal” 
These data are from the in vitro experiment, where Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis was cultured in various types and concentrations of leachate. Each row is a single replicate. 
Treatment = indicator of the leachate type by concentration treatment. 
PlantSp = the species of plant used to create the leachate for this replicate
Concentration = the concentration of plant litter used to create the leachate in g/L. 
Day = the sampling day that the sample was counted, with 1 = the first day of counting (day 10 of the experiment) 
TotalZp = the total number of zoospores in the subsample
MovingZp = the number of moving zoospores in the subsample
TotalSporangia = the number of zoosporangia in the subsample



For the file “Experiment_2_tadpoles_Martin_etal”
These data are from experiment 2, which was the first tadpole exposure trial. Each row is a single tadpole (replicate). 
TID = tadpole identification number, or replicate number
treatment = numerical indicator of the treatment type 
leachate = an indicator of the plant species used to create the leachate with SB (steeplebush), BH (black huckleberry), CA (cattail), PL (purple loosestrife), AO (autumn olive), and CR (common reed).
days_survived = the number of experimental days the tadpole survived
censored = an indicator of whether survival was censored with 0 = censored and 1 = not censored
infect_status = a numerical indicator of infection status with 0 =  not infected and 1 = infected. “NA” values are animals that were not tested for infection.
Quantmean = the estimated quantity of the pathogen (Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis) estimated from quantitative-PCR
log.quant.mean = the log10 of the “Quantmean” value 


For the file “Experiment_3_tadpoles_Martin_etal”
These data are from experiment 2, which was the second tadpole exposure trial. Each row is a single tadpole (replicate). 
 TID = tadpole identification number, or replicate number

leachate = an indicator of the plant species used to create the leachate with SB (steeplebush), BH (black huckleberry), CA (cattail), PL (purple loosestrife), AO (autumn olive), and CR (common reed).
days_survived = the number of experimental days the tadpole survived
censored = an indicator of whether survival was censored with 0 = censored and 1 = not censored
infect_status = a numerical indicator of infection status with 0 =  not infected and 1 = infected. “NA” values are animals that were not tested for infection.
Quantmean = the estimated quantity of the pathogen (Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis) estimated from quantitative-PCR
Log_Quantmean = the log10 of the “Quantmean” value 
stage = the Gosner developmental stage of the tadpole at the end of the experiment
mass = the mas (g) of the tadpole at the end of the experiment
